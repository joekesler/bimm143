> Q13: Read this file into R and determine the sample size for each genotype and their 
corresponding median expression levels for each of these genotypes.

First, I will bring in the table

```{r}
rs <- read.table("rs8067378_ENSG00000172057.6.txt")
head(rs)
```

Now I will determine the sample size.

```{r}
summary(rs)
```

The samples size is for each genotype is 462 and the median is 25.116

> Q14: Generate a boxplot with a box per genotype, what could you infer from the relative 
expression value between A/A and G/G displayed in this plot? Does the SNP effect the 
expression of ORMDL3?

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(rs, aes(x = geno, y = exp)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```
Those that are A/A clearly express more than G/G judging by the boxplot, so I would conclude that ORMDL3 does affect expression
