## The RCSB Protein Databank (PBD)

Protein structures by x-ray crystalography dominate this database.
We are skipping questions 1-3 because the website was too slow for us.

# The PDB format


> Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

This is because the resolution isn't big enough to see a very small hydrogen atom.

> Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

I believe it is HOH 308

> Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

## 3. Introduction to Bio3D in R

```{r}
library(bio3d)
```

To read a pbd file, we can use 'read.pbd()'
```{r}
pdb<- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```
> Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object?

198

> Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? 

MK1

> Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure? 

2

The ATOM records of a PDB file are stored in 'pdb$atom'

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```
## 4. Comparative structure analysis of Adenylate Kinase


> Q10 . Which of the packages above is found only on BioConductor and not CRAN? 

MSA

> Q11. Which of the above packages is not found on BioConductor or CRAN?:

bio3d-view

> Q12. True or False? Functions from the devtools package can be used to install packages from GitHub and BitBucket?

True

# Search an retrieve ADK structures

```{r}
library(bio3d)
aa <- get.seq("1ake_A")
aa
```
> Q13. How many amino acids are in this sequence, i.e. how long is this sequence?

214

```{r}
hits <- NULL
hits$pdb.id <- c('1AKE_A','6S36_A','6RZE_A','3HPR_A','1E4V_A','5EJE_A','1E4Y_A','3X2S_A','6HAP_A','6HAM_A','4K46_A','3GMT_A','4PZL_A')
```

```{r}
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)
```
```{r}
pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE, exefile="msa")
```
# PCA

```{r}
pc.xray <- pca(pdbs)
plot(pc.xray)
```
```{r}

rd <- rmsd(pdbs)

hc.rd <- hclust(dist(rd))
grps.rd <- cutree(hc.rd, k=3)

plot(pc.xray, 1:2, col="grey50", bg=grps.rd, pch=21, cex=1)
```
```{r}
modes <- nma(pdbs)
plot(modes, pdbs, col=grps.rd)
```
> Q14. What do you note about this plot? Are the black and colored lines similar or different? Where do you think they differ most and why?

The black and colored lines are similar in some spots and different in other spots. The spots where they are different are the dynamic sections of the protien where there are different conformational states.
